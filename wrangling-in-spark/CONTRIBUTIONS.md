# Wrangling in Spark

## Steps to contribute

1. Delete the folder [`wrangling-in-spark`](./wrangling-in-spark/). The changes in the contents should be driven from the .dbc file.

2. Export the updated `wrangling-in-spark` folder in DataBricks workspace as 
   a. "DBC Archive": This will be committed as [`wrangling-in-spark.dbc`](./wrangling-in-spark.dbc).
   b. "Source File": This will be committed as [`wrangling-in-spark.zip`](./wrangling-in-spark.zip).

3. Extract `wrangling-in-spark.zip`, move into [`wrangling-in-spark`](./wrangling-in-spark/) folder and rename accordingly.

4. Review the changes in [`wrangling-in-spark`](./wrangling-in-spark/). If changes needed, repeat steps 2 and 3.

5. When ready, commit the following
   - [`wrangling-in-spark.dbc`](./wrangling-in-spark.dbc)
   - [`wrangling-in-spark.zip`](./wrangling-in-spark.zip)
   - the folder for DataBricks python notebooks: [`wrangling-in-spark`](./wrangling-in-spark/).
